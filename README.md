# CIFAR10_CNN_Transfer_Learning
This project involves developing a CNN model for predicting the class label of the images in CIFAR10 dataset. Also, transfer learning concept using VGG16, Inception, and ResNet50 pre-trained models. <br>
The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research.[1][2] The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.[3] The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class.[4]

Computer algorithms for recognizing objects in photos often learn by example. CIFAR-10 is a set of images that can be used to teach a computer how to recognize objects. Since the images in CIFAR-10 are low-resolution (32x32), this dataset can allow researchers to quickly try different algorithms to see what works.

CIFAR-10 is a labeled subset of the 80 Million Tiny Images dataset from 2008, published in 2009. When the dataset was created, students were paid to label all of the images.[5]

Various kinds of convolutional neural networks tend to be the best at recognizing the images in CIFAR-10.
